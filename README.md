In this example, the emerging hotspot analysis from ArcGIS Pro was applied to the weekly methane concentrations data (i.e., weekly interpolated images) from 2019-2021. The data for the monsoon season (May-October) were excluded due to extensive missing data in those months. The emerging hotspot analysis evaluates spatiotemporal patterns in methane concentrations using a combination of two statistical measures 1) the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic to identify hot spots and cold spots of methane concentrations for each week, and 2) the Mann Kendall trend test to examine how hot spots and cold spots have evolved over time.
